## Why I Built This
Life gets busy, and goals sometimes slip through the cracks. I wanted a tool that’s not just functional but actually enjoyable to use, something to help me plan my savings in a smart, stress-free way.

So, I built Smart Goal Planner to make goal-setting clear, manageable, and visually motivating, because tracking progress should feel rewarding, not overwhelming.

Add, edit, and delete financial goals with ease. Set target amounts, deadlines, and categories to keep things organized.

 - Deposit Tracking:
Keep tabs on how much you've saved toward each goal and make deposits right in the app.

- Visual Overview:
Get an at-a-glance summary of your total savings and progress on individual goals.

- Clean & Responsive UI:
Whether you’re on your phone or desktop, the app adapts smoothly for a great experience everywhere.
